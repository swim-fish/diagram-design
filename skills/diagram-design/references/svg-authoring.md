# SVG Authoring Details

Read only the section needed for the selected diagram. Explicit user choices and
the effective profile override default styling examples. Section numbers retain
the routing vocabulary used by the type references and SKILL.md.

## 4. Universal Anti-patterns

These mark "AI slop" schematics of any type:

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Dark mode + cyan/purple glow | Looks "technical" without design decisions |
| JetBrains Mono as blanket "dev" font | Mono is for *technical* content — ports, commands, URLs. Names go in Geist sans. |
| Identical boxes for every node | Erases hierarchy |
| Legend floating inside the diagram area | Collides with nodes |
| Arrow labels with no masking rect | Bleeds through the line |
| Vertical `writing-mode` text on arrows | Unreadable |
| 3 equal-width summary cards as default | Generic grid — vary widths |
| Shadow on any element | Shadows are out. Borders are in. |
| `rounded-2xl` on boxes | Max radius 6–10px or none |
| Coral on every "important" node | Coral is 1–2 editorial accents, not a signaling system |
| Reproducing Mermaid's renderer layout | Imports automatic spacing and routing instead of making an editorial layout |
| Any breach of the six §6 connector rules | Diagonal slants, labels touching their stroke, masks clipped by a later node, overlapping paths, shared attach points, transit behind a non-endpoint box — each is an automatic fail; §6 states them in full |

Type-specific anti-patterns live in each type reference linked in the guide.

## 5. Design System

**The design system is skinnable.** All colors, typography, and tokens live in a single source of truth — [`style-guide.md`](style-guide.md). This file describes semantic roles (`paper`, `ink`, `muted`, `accent`, `link`, …). The default skin is a cool editorial palette (white-smoke paper, jet-black ink, atomic-tangerine accent, blue-slate muted, silver hairlines); to apply a brand, resolve the effective project profile or use task-local tokens via [`onboarding.md`](onboarding.md). Persist a profile only when requested.

> When specs below or in type references mention "ink", "accent", "muted", etc., look up the current value in the effective profile or task-local token set; `style-guide.md` supplies defaults.

### Semantic roles (at a glance)

| Role | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `paper`, `paper-2` | Page bg and container bg |
| `ink` | Primary text / stroke |
| `muted`, `soft` | Secondary text, default arrows, sublabels |
| `rule`, `rule-solid` | Hairline borders |
| `accent`, `accent-tint` | 1–2 focal elements per diagram |
| `link` | HTTP/API calls, external arrows |

**Focal rule:** `accent` goes on 1–2 elements max. Everything else is `ink` / `muted` / `soft`. If you're tempted to accent 4 things, you haven't decided what's focal yet.

### Node type → treatment

| Type | Fill | Stroke |
|---|---|---|
| **Focal** (1–2 max) | `accent-tint` | `accent` |
| **Backend / API / Step** | white | `ink` |
| **Store / State** | `ink @ 0.05` | `muted` |
| **External / Cloud** | `ink @ 0.03` | `ink @ 0.30` |
| **Input / User** | `muted @ 0.10` | `soft` |
| **Optional / Async** | `ink @ 0.02` | `ink @ 0.20` dashed `4,3` |
| **Security / Boundary** | `accent @ 0.05` | `accent @ 0.50` dashed `4,4` |

### Typography (summary — full spec in style-guide.md)

- **Title** — Instrument Serif, 1.75rem, 400 — H1 only
- **Node name** — Geist (sans), 12px, 600 — human-readable labels
- **Sublabel** — Geist Mono, 9px — ports, URLs, field types
- **Eyebrow / tag** — Geist Mono, 7–8px, uppercase, tracked — type tags, axis labels
- **Arrow label** — Geist Mono, 8px — annotation on arrows
- **Editorial aside** — Instrument Serif *italic*, 14px — callouts only

**CJK labels** — Geist and Instrument Serif carry no Hangul or Han; extend the family and keep CJK at 12px+. Rules: [Korean](style-guide.md#korean-labels), [Chinese](style-guide.md#traditional-chinese-labels).

**Mono is for technical content only** — never as a blanket "dev" font, and never JetBrains Mono.

## 6. Core SVG Primitives

Universal building blocks. Type-specialized primitives (lifeline, activation bar, region) live in the relevant type reference linked in the guide. Optional primitives:

- Editorial callouts → [primitive-annotation.md](primitive-annotation.md)
- Hand-drawn variant → [primitive-sketchy.md](primitive-sketchy.md)
- Icon set (laptop, server, DB, K8s, Docker, AWS, …) → [primitive-icons.md](primitive-icons.md). Browse the gallery at [`../assets/icons.html`](../assets/icons.html).
- Terminal / CLI-window variant → [primitive-terminal.md](primitive-terminal.md)
- Optional explanatory motion → [animation.md](animation.md)

### Background

**Default: clean paper, no dot pattern.** Single `<rect>` filled with `paper`. Don't wrap the diagram in a secondary container background — the diagram sits directly on the page.

```svg
<rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="#f5f5f5"/>
```

**Optional: dotted paper variant.** When a long-form editorial diagram benefits from textured ground (essays, hero diagrams on a dedicated page), opt in by adding the `dots` pattern and a second rect:

```svg
<defs>
  <pattern id="dots" width="22" height="22" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
    <circle cx="1" cy="1" r="0.9" fill="rgba(45,49,66,0.10)"/>
  </pattern>
</defs>
<rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="#f5f5f5"/>
<rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#dots)" opacity="0.6"/>
```

Don't use the dot pattern when the diagram sits inside a product page, slide, or card — the texture compounds with surrounding chrome and reads as noise.

### Arrow markers (define only the roles used)

```svg
<marker id="arrow" markerWidth="8" markerHeight="6" refX="7" refY="3" orient="auto">
  <polygon points="0 0, 8 3, 0 6" fill="#4f5d75"/>
</marker>
<marker id="arrow-accent" markerWidth="8" markerHeight="6" refX="7" refY="3" orient="auto">
  <polygon points="0 0, 8 3, 0 6" fill="#eb6c36"/>
</marker>
<marker id="arrow-link" markerWidth="8" markerHeight="6" refX="7" refY="3" orient="auto">
  <polygon points="0 0, 8 3, 0 6" fill="#2e5aa8"/>
</marker>
```

| Arrow | Stroke | When |
|---|---|---|
| Default | muted `#4f5d75` | Internal, generic |
| Accent | coral `#eb6c36` | Primary / highlighted / headline |
| Link-blue | `#2e5aa8` | HTTP/API calls, external systems |
| Dashed | `stroke-dasharray="5,4"` + any color | Optional, passive, return, async |

**Draw arrows before boxes** so z-order puts lines behind nodes.

### Mandatory connector rules

These six rules are **non-negotiable**. Run the pre-output checklist (§9) to verify before producing any diagram.

1. **Rounded right-angle (orthogonal) connectors are mandatory.** Never use diagonal `<line>` or straight slanted paths between nodes that don't share an x or y axis. Every bend must be a quarter-arc with `r=8` (or `r=6` minimum for tight layouts). See `type-architecture.md` for the elbow-path formula. Reserve plain straight `<line>` only for connections whose endpoints share the same x or y coordinate. Diagonal connectors are an automatic fail.

2. **Label-to-connector margin: 6–10px gap, always.** A label must never sit *on* its arrow — the connector must remain visible. Place the label centered above (or beside, for vertical segments) the line with a **minimum 6px gap** between the bottom of the label's mask rect and the connector stroke. The opaque mask rect prevents the arrow from bleeding through, but the *visible* gap between mask edge and line preserves the reader's ability to trace the connection. If the label is large enough that 6px feels cramped, push it to 8–10px. Never let the mask rect touch or overlap the stroke.

3. **No overlapping connectors.** Two connectors must never share the same stroke path, run parallel on top of each other, or be drawn on top of each other for any segment. When two orthogonal arrows must cross at a single point, apply the **bridge / hop** primitive (see `type-architecture.md` § Crossing arrows). When two arrows naturally want to overlap, offset their routing by ≥12px so each line is independently traceable. If you find yourself stacking connectors, redesign the layout — it means two nodes are too close, or the diagram is over budget (split into overview + detail).

4. **Shared edge → fan the attach points.** When two or more connectors enter or exit the *same edge* of a box, each must have its own distinct attach point along that edge — **no two connectors may share a single point on a box**. Spread the attach points evenly along the edge with **≥12px** between adjacent points (8px minimum for very small boxes). Routing rules:
   - For N connectors on an edge of length L, attach point `k` (1..N) sits at offset `L * k / (N + 1)` from the edge's leading corner.
   - When the connectors fan out to destinations on different sides, route each one orthogonally from its own attach point — no merging strokes near the box.
   - When two parallel connectors run in the same direction, keep them ≥12px apart along their entire length, not just at the attach point. Each arrow must remain independently traceable end-to-end.

   No connector may hide another. If you can't tell two arrows apart at a glance, the layout has failed.

5. **A connector must not pass behind a box that isn't its source or destination — except when the box is geometrically unavoidable on a direct orthogonal path.** Reroute around intervening boxes by default. The only legitimate exception is when a cross-cutting node (e.g., a footer service, a horizontal layer bar) physically sits between the connector's source and destination on the only straight path between them. In that exception:
   - The stroke must be **dashed** (e.g., `stroke-dasharray="4,3"`) to signal "transit, not interaction" — it tells the reader the intervening box is not an endpoint.
   - The label sits at the **visible end** of the connector (typically near the source) so it doesn't fall behind the intervening box.
   - No marker (arrowhead) may land on the intervening box's edge — the marker resolves at the true destination only.

   When in doubt, reroute. The exception exists for the narrow case where rerouting is geometrically impossible, not as a shortcut to avoid layout work.

6. **A label mask must not overlap a node drawn after it.** Rule 2 keeps the label off its own connector; this one keeps it off the boxes. Because nodes are painted after labels, a mask that lands partly inside a node is covered by the node fill and the text renders as a fragment sitting on the node border. Place the label on a segment of the connector that runs through open canvas — for a connector leaving a node's right edge, that means clearing the node's `x + width` before the mask starts. A mask fully *inside* a node is a badge chip and is fine; a mask overlapping a zone container is fine too, since zones are painted first. From a repository checkout, verify with `python3 <repo-root>/scripts/verify-geometry.py <file>`.

### Node box — full pattern

```svg
<!-- 1. Opaque paper mask — prevents arrows bleeding through transparent fills -->
<rect x="X" y="Y" width="W" height="H" rx="6" fill="#f5f5f5"/>
<!-- 2. Styled box -->
<rect x="X" y="Y" width="W" height="H" rx="6" fill="FILL" stroke="STROKE" stroke-width="1"/>
<!-- 3. Rectangular type tag (rx=2, NOT a pill) -->
<rect x="X+8" y="Y+6" width="28" height="12" rx="2" fill="transparent" stroke="STROKE@0.40" stroke-width="0.8"/>
<text x="X+22" y="Y+15" fill="STROKE@0.8" font-size="7" font-family="'Geist Mono', monospace"
      text-anchor="middle" letter-spacing="0.08em">API</text>
<!-- 4. Node name (Geist sans — human-readable) -->
<text x="CX" y="CY+2" fill="#2d3142" font-size="12" font-weight="600"
      font-family="'Geist', sans-serif" text-anchor="middle">Node Name</text>
<!-- 5. Technical sublabel (Geist Mono) -->
<text x="CX" y="CY+18" fill="#4f5d75" font-size="9"
      font-family="'Geist Mono', monospace" text-anchor="middle">tech:port</text>
```

### Arrow labels — always mask, always with margin

Every arrow label needs an opaque rect behind it. Without one it bleeds through the line. **And the label must sit with a visible gap above the connector — never on top of it.**

```svg
<!-- Mask sits 14px above the arrow (8px text height + 6px gap). Stroke is at ARROW_Y. -->
<rect x="MID_X-18" y="ARROW_Y-20" width="36" height="12" rx="2" fill="#f5f5f5"/>
<text x="MID_X" y="ARROW_Y-11" fill="#7a8399" font-size="8"
      font-family="'Geist Mono', monospace" text-anchor="middle" letter-spacing="0.06em">WRITE</text>
```

Rules:

- ≤14 characters, all-caps, centered on segment midpoint.
- **Mandatory 6–10px gap** between the bottom of the mask rect and the arrow stroke. The connector must remain visible — a label that hides its own arrow is a hard fail.
- Never `writing-mode` vertical.
- For vertical segments, place the label to the side (not on the line) with the same 6–10px horizontal gap.

### Legend — horizontal strip at the bottom

**Never put the legend inside the diagram area.** Place as a horizontal strip after all nodes, with a hairline separator:

```svg
<line x1="30" y1="LEGEND_Y-8" x2="VIEWBOX_W-30" y2="LEGEND_Y-8"
      stroke="rgba(45,49,66,0.10)" stroke-width="0.8"/>
<text x="30" y="LEGEND_Y+8" fill="#4f5d75" font-size="8" font-family="'Geist Mono', monospace"
      letter-spacing="0.14em">LEGEND</text>
<!-- Items — horizontal row, ~160px apart -->
```

Expand SVG `viewBox` height by ~60px.

## 7. Layout & Spacing

### 4px grid

Use a 4px base grid for major node dimensions, positions, padding, and gaps.
Typography, optical alignment, connector attachment formulas, corner radii, and
curve control points may use other values. The effective profile and output-size
type ramp take precedence over the default measurements below.

| Category | Allowed values |
|---|---|
| Font sizes | 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40 |
| Node width / height | 80, 96, 112, 120, 128, 140, 144, 160, 180, 200, 240, 320 |
| x / y coordinates | multiples of 4 |
| Gap between nodes | 20, 24, 32, 40, 48 |
| Padding inside boxes | 8, 12, 16 |
| Border radius | 4, 6, 8 |

Exempt: stroke widths (0.8, 1, 1.2), opacity values, and the 22×22 dot-pattern.

Check grid-aligned geometry numerically with `value % 4`, not by its last digit.
Do not round text or curve geometry blindly.

### Complexity budget (per diagram)

| Limit | Rule |
|---|---|
| Max nodes | 9 |
| Max arrows / transitions | 12 |
| Max coral elements | 2 |
| Max lifelines (sequence) | 5 |
| Max combined fragments (sequence) | 1 (default); 2 only if each is single-region `opt`/`loop` |
| Max `alt` regions (sequence) | 2 |
| Max fragment nesting (sequence) | 1 |
| Max lanes (swimlane) | 5 |
| Max items (quadrant) | 12 |
| Max entities (ER) | 8 |
| Max nesting levels (nested) | 6 |
| Max tree depth | 4 |
| Max org chart depth | 4 |
| Max org chart nodes | 12 |
| Max layers (layer stack) | 6 |
| Max circles (venn) | 3 |
| Max layers (pyramid) | 6 |
| Max radar axes | 5 |
| Max radar series | 5 |
| Max focal radar series | 1 |
| Max polar categories | 8 |
| Max polar series | 1 |
| Max focal polar categories | 1 |
| Max bars (bar chart) | 8 |
| Max bars (waterfall) | 8 incl. totals, 1 subtotal |
| Max cells (treemap) | 8 |
| Max series (line chart) | 5 |
| Max tasks (Gantt) | 12 |
| Max points (scatter plot) | 30 |
| Max stages / nodes / flows (sankey) | 3 / 8 / 12 |
| Max categories (fishbone) | 6 bones, 3 sub-causes each |
| Max components / links (wardley) | 9 / 12, 2 movement arrows |
| Max columns / cards (kanban) | 5 / 12 total, 4 per column |
| Max stages / rows (user journey) | 6 / 3, 2 pain markers |
| Max zones / nodes / paths (deployment) | 3 / 6 / 8, 9 artifacts |
| Max nodes / edges (dependency) | 9 / 14, 4 ranks, 1 cycle |
| Max classes / relationships (UML class) | 7 / 8, 5 members per compartment |
| Max activities / slices / cards (story map) | 5 / 3 / 12 |
| Max tables / columns / FKs (db schema) | 5 / 8 shown / 6 |
| Max annotation callouts | 2 |
| Max motion (optional) | 8 steps, 12 marked items, 2 simultaneous items — see [animation.md](animation.md) |

When density harms legibility, split into overview and detail or use the selected
type/import budget. Specific type and import limits override generic node/edge
defaults. Preserve required content and disclose any requested summarization.

### Page layout

1. **Header** — eyebrow (Geist Mono), title (Instrument Serif), optional subtitle (Geist muted).
2. **Diagram container** — default: **clean, borderless**, no background — the SVG sits directly on the page paper. Optional *framed* variant (for card-heavy layouts or hero placements): `paper-2` bg + 1px `rule` border + 8px radius + `1.5rem` padding + `overflow-x: auto`.
3. **Summary cards** — 2–3 col grid with *varied* widths (e.g., `1.1fr 1fr 0.9fr`).
4. **Footer** — colophon in Geist Mono, muted, hairline top border.

---

## 8. Summary Card Pattern

Don't use 3 identical generic cards. Vary the treatment:

```html
<div class="card">
  <p class="eyebrow">SECTION LABEL</p>
  <div class="card-header">
    <span class="card-dot coral"></span>
    <h3>Card Title</h3>
  </div>
  <ul><li>Item</li></ul>
</div>
```

Rules:

- `background: #ffffff` (not paper — slight lift without shadow)
- `border: 1px solid rgba(45,49,66,0.12)`
- `border-radius: 6px`, `padding: 1.25rem`
- **No `box-shadow`**
- Card dots: 7px, `border-radius: 50%` — ink / muted / coral / link / soft variants

## 9. Pre-Output Checklist (Taste Gate)

Run before producing any diagram.

**Type fit:**

- [ ] If behavior matters, did I choose one semantic pattern before the visual type and load `semantic-patterns.md`?
- [ ] Right visual type for the layout? (§3 visual-type guide)
- [ ] Stated type, pattern, size preset, and planned cuts before drawing — confirmed, or assumptions noted? (§3)
- [ ] Would a table / paragraph do the same job? (If yes — don't draw.)
- [ ] Loaded the matching type reference linked in the visual-type guide?
- [ ] If this is an import — format, size, detail level, and audience set? `viewBox` and type ramp match the size preset? (§11, [output-spec.md §6](output-spec.md))
- [ ] If this is an import — fidelity ledger ready to report? (§11)

**Remove test:**

- [ ] Can I remove any node? (Would a reader still understand?)
- [ ] Can I merge any two nodes? (Do they always travel together?)
- [ ] Can I remove any arrow? (Is the relationship obvious from layout?)
- [ ] Can I remove any label? (Does color or shape already signal it?)

**Signal:**

- [ ] Coral used on ≤2 elements? If more, which actually deserve focal status?
- [ ] Legend covers every type used — and nothing extra?
- [ ] Within the type's complexity budget (§7)?

**Technical:**

- [ ] Diagram `<svg>` has `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` resolving to its `<title>` and `<desc>`?
- [ ] `<title>` is the first child of `<svg>` (before `<defs>`) and both `<title>` and `<desc>` are filled in?
- [ ] `<title>` / `<desc>` IDs are prefixed for this diagram and variant — never bare `title` / `desc`?
- [ ] Arrows drawn before boxes?
- [ ] **Every connector between off-axis nodes uses a rounded right-angle elbow (`r=8`)? No diagonal `<line>` slants?**
- [ ] **Every arrow label has a visible 6–10px gap above its connector? (Mask rect not touching the stroke.)**
- [ ] **No two connectors overlap, share a stroke path, or run on top of each other? Crossings use the bridge/hop primitive?**
- [ ] **When several connectors enter or exit the same edge of a box, each has its own attach point (≥12px apart)? No connector hides another?**
- [ ] **No connector passes behind a non-endpoint box, except the unavoidable-intervening-box case (§6 rule 5) — and in that case, the stroke is dashed and the label sits at the visible end?**
- [ ] **No label mask overlaps a node drawn after it? (Node fill would clip the text — §6 rule 6. From a repository checkout, run `python3 <repo-root>/scripts/verify-geometry.py <file>`.)**
- [ ] Every arrow label has an opaque mask using the effective `paper` token?
- [ ] Legend is a horizontal bottom strip, not floating?
- [ ] No vertical `writing-mode` text?
- [ ] `viewBox` expanded for the legend strip (~60px)?
- [ ] Major geometry uses the 4px grid where applicable, with typography and optical exceptions preserved?
- [ ] From the installed skill directory, did `python3 scripts/self_check.py <file>` pass? (Accessible-SVG contract, single-file safety, motion basics; ships with the skill.)
- [ ] If animated, does the complete static/no-JS frame work, does reduced motion hide/disable playback, and is the controller copied verbatim from `../assets/template-motion.html`? From a repository checkout, also run `python3 <repo-root>/scripts/verify-motion.py path/to/generated.html` plus the skin linter; from an installed skill, manually check print and static-query states on top of the self-check.

**Typography (effective profile overrides the default examples):**

- [ ] Brand match uses exact public families/weights, verified via `getComputedStyle`; fallbacks disclosed?
- [ ] Human-readable names use the effective sans role, with language-appropriate glyph coverage?
- [ ] Technical sublabels use the effective technical-label role?
- [ ] Page title uses the effective title role?
- [ ] Annotation callouts (if any) follow the effective callout role? (see [primitive-annotation.md](primitive-annotation.md))
- [ ] No blanket monospace treatment unless explicitly chosen by the user or profile?
